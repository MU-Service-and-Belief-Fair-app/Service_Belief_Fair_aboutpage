1.  The purpose of our project is to inform students about the service and belief fairs

2. It is designed for busy college students who cannot attend the fair. It is also designed for students new to the St. Louis area who are trying to find new organizations and connections in the area

3. It centralizes all of the service and belief organizations to one place. this allows students to learn about any organization whenever they want.
